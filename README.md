# Analysis of Crime Against Women

## Introduction
The incidents of "Crimes Against Women" in India have witnessed an annual increase through the years. Despite changing forms, places, patterns, and props, the underlying situation of oppression and suppression of women remains the same. This project aims to analyze datasets containing past records of such incidents to investigate and predict the socio-economic factors responsible for the increase in crime rates against women in India. By identifying these factors, we aim to find potential solutions to address the issue.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
- Study the various crimes committed against women in India.
- Visualize and analyze the data interactively using different visual idioms and encoding techniques.
- Conduct a state-wise analysis of crimes committed against women across India.
- Highlight the most common crimes committed in 2021 using visual idioms.
- Identify the most common types of crimes and the age group most affected by them through visual idioms.
- Analyze the factors influencing crimes against women and identify trends using visual idioms.
